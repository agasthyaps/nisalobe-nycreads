# NYS Next Generation ELA Learning Standards (2017, rev. 2019) — LLM Overview

## Purpose & Scope
PreK–12 standards revised 2017 (minor typo corrections 2018–2019). Replaces older CCSS-based NY standards. Organized as: **Anchor Standards → Grade-Level Standards → Appendices**. Document covers grades PK, K, 1–5, 6–8 (as 6/7/8), 9–10, 11–12.

## Architecture

### Four Domains
| Domain | Code | Anchor Standards # |
|--------|------|--------------------|
| Reading | R | 9 |
| Writing | W | 7 |
| Speaking & Listening | SL | 6 |
| Language | L | 6 |

### Reading Standards Split
All grade-level reading standards bifurcate into:
- **RL** = Literary text (stories, drama, poetry, fiction)
- **RI** = Informational text (nonfiction, biography, articles, charts, digital)
- **RI&RL** = applies to both

Some standards apply identically; others have distinct RL/RI versions at grade level.

### Standard Code Format
`[Grade][Domain][Standard#][sub]` → e.g., `4W1a` = Grade 4, Writing, Standard 1, sub-standard a
Grade bands: `PK`, `K`, `1`–`8`, `9-10`, `11-12`

## Anchor Standards (Aspirational College/Career Goals)

### Reading (R1–R9)
- **R1** Close reading, textual evidence, logical inference
- **R2** Central idea/theme; summary
- **R3** How individuals/events/ideas develop and interact
- **R4** Word meaning (technical, connotative, figurative); word choice → meaning/tone
- **R5** Text structure (sentence → paragraph → whole)
- **R6** Point of view/purpose; draws on global/diverse texts *(NYS addition vs CCSS)*
- **R7** Diverse media/formats integration
- **R8** Argument/claims; validity of reasoning, sufficiency of evidence
- **R9** Literary forms, elements, devices; multiple lenses/perspectives *(significantly revised from CCSS R9)*

### Writing (W1–W7)
- **W1** Argument writing (claim, reasoning, evidence)
- **W2** Informative/explanatory writing
- **W3** Narrative writing (real or imagined)
- **W4** Personal/cultural/textual/thematic connections across genres *(NYS-distinctive standard)*
- **W5** Text-based evidence for analysis, reflection, research
- **W6** Research from focused questions
- **W7** Multi-source research; credibility assessment; avoid plagiarism

### Speaking & Listening (SL1–SL6)
- **SL1** Collaborative discussion; diverse partners
- **SL2** Diverse media/formats integration
- **SL3** Evaluate speaker's reasoning and rhetoric
- **SL4** Present findings; organization appropriate to audience/purpose
- **SL5** Strategic digital media use in presentations
- **SL6** Code-switching; academic English when appropriate

### Language (L1–L6)
- **L1** Grammar/usage conventions
- **L2** Capitalization, punctuation, spelling
- **L3** Language in context; style choices
- **L4** Unknown word strategies (context, morphology, reference)
- **L5** Figurative language, word relationships, nuance
- **L6** Academic + content-specific vocabulary

---

## Lifelong Practices (Non-Standards Philosophy)
Two lists framing the spirit of the document:
- **Readers**: read widely/often, self-select, persevere through complex text, make connections (self/other texts/cultures/eras), monitor comprehension
- **Writers**: write widely/often, experiment with language, analyze mentor texts, plan/revise/edit iteratively

These are dispositional goals, not measurable standards — important for conversations about pedagogical intent.

---

## Grade-Level Progression Logic

### Foundational Skills (PreK–Grade 5 only)
Domain **RF** (Reading Foundational) exists only in early grades:
- Print concepts → Phonological awareness → Phonics/word recognition → Fluency
- RF standards phase out by Grade 5 (some sub-standards explicitly noted as N/A at higher grades)

### Key Developmental Shifts
| Band | Signature moves |
|------|----------------|
| PK | Emergent literacy; read-alouds; play-based; oral language primary |
| K–2 | Decoding, sight words, concepts of print; short written responses; opinion writing begins |
| 3–5 | Extended writing; argument structure introduced; research skills; text complexity ramps; academic language distinction |
| 6–8 | Analysis deepens; multiple texts compared; author's craft; evidence quality assessed; formal academic writing |
| 9–10 | Complex argument; synthesis across texts/media; rhetoric; independent research |
| 11–12 | Sophisticated literary analysis; complex rhetoric; extended research; college-ready conventions |

### How Standards Scale
Each anchor standard has a corresponding grade-level version. Growth is expressed through:
1. **Text complexity** increases
2. **Cognitive demand** increases (identify → analyze → evaluate → critique)
3. **Independence** increases (teacher-supported → collaborative → independent)
4. **Scope** widens (single text → multiple texts → cross-genre/medium)

## Equity & Access Provisions (Repeated at Each Grade)
Every grade section includes explicit guidance for:
- **ELLs/MLLs**: bilingual demonstration of skills counts; home language transfer recognized; annotation markers throughout
- **Students with Disabilities**: IEP-driven; same high standards with specially designed instruction; age-appropriate participation emphasized

---

## Language Standards Structure (Appendix A)
L1 (grammar) and L2 (punctuation/spelling) are organized in **grade bands** (K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–10, 11–12), not individual grades. Local curriculum decides which skills per grade within the band. Arrow (→) notation indicates cross-band continuity. Not intended to be mastered by end of any single grade.

---

## Glossary Highlights (Appendix B)
Key terms with precise definitional scope:
- **Academic language**: discipline-specific terms + general academic connective language ("however," "research suggests")
- **Text complexity**: quantitative + qualitative + reader/task — not just readability score
- **Argumentative writing**: reason/logic-based; opinion writing is the K–2 precursor
- **Central idea**: interchangeable with "main idea" in these standards
- **Scaffolding**: *temporary*, strategy-aligned supports — implies eventual removal
- **Theme**: almost always *implied*, not stated; explores timeless/universal ideas
- **Point of view**: used differently for literary (narrative POV) vs. informational (author's perspective)

---

## Notable NYS-Specific Departures from CCSS
1. **W4** (personal/cultural/thematic connections) — no CCSS equivalent; reflects NY's emphasis on diverse/global perspectives
2. **R6** — explicitly includes "global and diverse texts"
3. **R9** — reframed around literary elements, forms, and "lenses/perspectives" vs CCSS's text comparison focus
4. **ELL/MLL** provisions more explicit and integrated than CCSS
5. Language standards in **grade bands** rather than individual grades (more flexibility)
6. **Lifelong Practices** framing — dispositional/habitual goals beyond measurable standards

---

## Revision History (2019 Addendum)
Only typographical corrections, no substantive changes:
- `KW1`: "topic" → "opinion"
- `5SL1d`: "conclusion" → "conclusions"
- `2RF3e`: "worlds" → "words"
- `5R5(RI)`: mislabeled RL → corrected to RI
- `6R5`, `7R5`, `8R5`: "themes and central ideas" → "themes or central ideas" (consistency across band)

---

## Conversational Handles for Discussion
- **Standards vs. curriculum**: These define *what*, not *how*. No texts are mandated.
- **Text complexity debate**: The three-part model (quantitative/qualitative/reader+task) opens space for professional judgment — teachers are not bound to Lexile alone.
- **Argument vs. opinion**: Distinction is developmental and explicit — K–2 "opinion," 3–12 "argument." Has implications for how early persuasive writing is scaffolded.
- **The R9 reframe**: Shift from "compare two texts" to "literary lenses and perspectives" is philosophically significant — moves toward critical literacy and reader-as-interpreter.
- **W4 as identity standard**: Personal/cultural connections in writing is a values statement about whose experiences belong in academic writing.
- **Lifelong Practices as counterweight**: The dispositional framing pushes back against purely skills-based, test-prep interpretation of the standards.
