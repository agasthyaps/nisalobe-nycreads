New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 10   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION   DEPARTMENT     Prekindergarten  English Language Arts  Learning Standards   PL EASE NOTE:   These Standards are  intended for four - year - old prekindergarten students.   Prekindergarten Introduction   Guidance and Support   Guidance and support are an integral part of developmentally appropriate practice. As children are gaining  mastery of the standards in  prekindergarten, some students may require support to demonstrate skills.    Range of Student Reading Experiences for Prekindergarten    Students in prekindergarten should experience a balance of literature and informational texts in the  context of instruction   designed to create opportunities for children to engage with a variety of topics, and  texts, and have discussions about texts that support language development and knowledge building.  Creating this learning environment for emergent readers can take a variety of formats, including read - alouds, shared readings, pretend readings, learning activities and play that incorporate literacy materials,  talking, experimenting with written materials, and other literacy activities.    We refer to these instructional  event s as ‘reading or literacy experiences’ because the focus is on using texts, printed and visual, to develop  emergent readers’ concepts of how meaning is conveyed through reading and writing while building their  language and knowledge.    It is not enough to s imply feature a variety of literary and informational text types in Prekindergarten  environments and classroom instruction; these texts must be made accessible and meaningful to young  readers as a component of fostering engagement with literacy to build language and knowledge. For  example, educators should provide and engage developing readers with an assortment of fiction and non - fiction age - appropriate books in the library area that are displayed attractively and used regularly, rotated  often; connected t o instructional themes and    feature cultural diversity; incorporate text materials into  many different aspects of the classroom curriculum, including authentic informational text materials for  use in play and to guide learning centers; and select a variety   of text types that engage children’s interests  and support their learning about the themes under study.     PK  

New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 11   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION   DEPARTMENT   The following are examples of literary and informational text types to be used in classroom instruction and  to create the literacy - rich learning environments.    Texts are not limited to these examples.   LITERATURE:   picture books, stories,  drama, poetry, fiction, fairytales, nursery rhymes, folk tales, tall  tales, and other literary texts.   INFORMATIONAL TEXT:   picture books, nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles  about science, art, history, social studies, and informati on displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print  and digital sources.    Text Complexity Expectations for Prekindergarten  Students in Prekindergarten are at the early emergent reader level and haven’t developed the  foundational word reading skills ne cessary to read texts independently.   However, it is crucial that  prekindergarten students actively engage in large and small group interactive read - aloud discussions of  texts that are content - rich and age - appropriate.    These texts should be part of the cur ricular materials as  well as those best sellers from a variety of publishers found in libraries across the state, and therefore  serve as a platform for building listening comprehension processes, to promote deeper - level thinking.   English Language Learners/ Multilingual Learners  English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the school system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary language.    While building p roficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages  T he eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) standards is to support the   lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to  indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts  and skills embedded in the ELA standards.    Throughout the  Standards, the use of annotation marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs.    St udents with Disabilities  Children with disabilities and their typically developing peers are all capable of learning, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Preschool children with disabilities need specially designed instruction  and related services designed to address their disability and ensure their participation in age appropriate  activities with  typically- developing  peers. Each preschool child with a disability has an individualized  educational program (IEP) which documents his/her individual goals, supports, and services as  determined by his/her needs, strengths, and abilities. These individual supports, accommodatio ns, and  services are designed to assist the child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning  Standards. With the appropriate services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in  prekindergarten experiences with thei r  typically - developing   peers and be held to the same high standards  and expectations as those without disabilities.

New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 14   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION   DEPARTMENT   Prekindergarten Writing Standards |  PKW  Production and Range of Writing for Prekindergarten   T o foster prekindergartners’ emergent writing skills, they should actively engage in group and individual  writing activities, where the focus is on helping them understand writing and drawing as a means for  communication with others and as an important tool   to support their own thinking and learning. Students  should be exposed to and prompted to produce a range of text types as they dictate, draw to convey  meaning, and make early attempts at producing letters, words, and letter strings. These text types incl ude  narratives (retellings of events they have experienced or fictional stories) as well as responses to  narratives, pieces of expository writing (shopping lists and notes/letters/p ictures to classmates or adults  in the community), and informational texts   (such as ‘how - to’ books, and diagrams and pictures that  generate, represent, or express information).    Conceptualized broadly, these writing experiences for our youngest learners should include opportunities  to narrate or dictate their stories and ideas t o an adult who is writing it down, as well as draw and illustrate  their ideas, especially making connections from read - alouds to writing. In these earliest years, we expect  the use of letter like forms, the use of random letter strings, and invented spelling as part of the  developmental progression. In addition to beginning to acquire alphabetic and orthographic skills — the  letter - sound connections and the letter combinations — students in prekindergarten should also begin to  learn about how technology and dig ital tools for writing can increase learning and communication (e.g., use  technology to write, draw, and explore concepts; begin to explore keyboards). Please see the Lifelong  Practices for Writers for examples of important lifelong writing habits that sho uld begin in the early years  and continue through life.   Text Types and Purposes  PKW1:    Use a combination of drawing, dictating, oral expression, and/or emergent writing to state an  opinion about a familiar topic in child - centered, authentic, play - based lea rning.

As children are gaining   mastery of the  S tandards in  kindergarten, some students may require support to demonstrate skills.    Ran ge of Stud ent Reading Experiences for K indergarten    Students in kindergarten should experience a balance of literature and informational texts in the context of  instruction designed to create opportunities for them to engage with a variety of topics, and t exts, and have  discussions about texts that support language development and knowledge building. Creating this learning  environment for emergent readers can take a variety of formats, including read - alouds, shared readings,  paired readings, learning activities and play that incorporates literacy materials, talking, experimenting  with written materials, and other literacy activities.    We refer to these instructional events as ‘reading or  literacy experiences’ because the focus is on using texts, printed and  visual, to develop emergent readers’  concepts of how meaning is conveyed through reading and writing while building their language and  knowledge.    It is not enough to simply feature a variety of literary and informational text types in Kindergarten  environ ments and classroom instruction; these texts must be made accessible and meaningful to young  readers as a component of fostering engagement with literacy to build language and knowledge. For  example, educators should provide and engage developing readers w ith an assortment of fiction and    non - fiction age - appropriate books in the library area that are displayed attractively and used regularly,  rotated often, connected to instructional themes, and    feature cultural diversity; incorporate text materials  into m any different aspects of the classroom curriculum, including authentic informational text materials  for use in play and to guide learning centers; and select a variety of text types that engage children’s  interests and support their learning about the theme under study. The following are examples of literary  and informational text types to be used in classroom instruction and to create literacy - rich environments.   

New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 19   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT   Texts are not limited to these examples.   LITERATURE:   picture books, stories, drama, poetry, fiction, fairytales, nursery rhymes, folk tales, tall  tales, and other literary texts   INFORMATIO NAL TEXT :    picture books, nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles  about science, art, history, social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print  and digital source s  Text Complexity Expectations for Kin dergarten   Students in kindergarten are at varying stages of development as word readers and as text comprehenders.  To develop each set of skills and competencies (word reading, text comprehension skills), different  instructional materials are required. Dur ing instruction to develop word readings skills, kindergarten  students should have authentic opportunities to engage with texts that specifically correlate to their  developing phonics and word reading skills. However, to bolster students’ text comprehensio n skills,  teachers should also provide large group, small group, and individual reading activities materials that are  content - rich and complex. For example, students should participate in interactive read - aloud discussions of  complex texts that they could  not read independently, in order to build background knowledge and  promote deeper - level thinking. Because each reader brings different skills and background knowledge to  their reading experiences, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible to a peer in the same  classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to allow all  students to access grade - level texts.    The most critical distinction, however, is the distinction between the  complexity of the texts u sed to teach a child to read the words on the page, and the complexity of the texts  used to build up their language and knowledge.   English Language Learners/Multilingual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the schoo l system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary language.    While building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual E ducation programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.    The eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) standards is to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to  indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA standards.    Throughout the  standards, the us e of annotation marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs.    GR K AD   E

As children are gaining  mastery of the standards in 1st grade, some  students may require support to demonstrate skills .   Range of Student Reading Experiences   for  1 st   Grade   Students in 1 st   grade should experience a balance of literature and informational texts in the context of  instruction designed to create opportunities f or children to engage with a variety of topics and texts, and  have discussions about texts that support language development and knowledge building. Creating this  learning environment for emergent readers can take a variety of formats, including read - aloud s, shared  readings, paired readings, learning activities and play that incorporates literacy materials, talking,  experimenting with written materials, and other literacy activities.   We refer to these instructional events as  ‘reading or literacy experiences’ because the focus is on using texts, printed and visual, to develop  emergent and early readers’ concepts of how meaning is conveyed through reading and writing, while  building their language and knowledge.    The following are examples of literary and info rmational text types that could be used in classroom  instruction and environments. Texts are not limited to these examples.   LITERATURE:   stories, drama, poetry, fiction, fairytales, nursery rhymes, folk tales, tall tales, and other  literary texts.   INFORMATI ONAL TEXT:    nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles about science,  art, history, social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print and digital  sources.  

New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 28   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT   T ext Complexity Expectations for 1 st   Grade    Students in 1 st   grade are at varying stages of development as word readers and as text comprehenders,  with some students strengthening emergent  reading skills and others reading at grade level or above. To  develop each set of skills and competencies (word reading, reading comprehension skills), different  instructional materials are required. During instruction to develop word reading skills, 1 st  g rade students  should have authentic opportunities to engage with texts that specifically correlate to their individual  levels of phonics and word reading skills. However, to bolster students’ text comprehension skills, teachers  should also provide large gr oup, small group, and individual reading activities, with materials that are  content - rich and complex at  age - appropriate levels . For example, students should participate in interactive  read - aloud discussions of more complex texts, which often cannot be rea d independently, in order to build  background knowledge and promote deeper - level thinking. Because each reader brings different skills and  background knowledge to the act of reading, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible to a  peer in the same classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to  allow all students to access grade - level texts.    The most critical distinction, however, is the distinction  between the complexity of the texts used to teach a   child to read the words on the page, and the  complexity of the texts used to build up their language and knowledge.   English Language Learners/Multilingual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the school system at a ll grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary language.    While building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.    The eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) standards is to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs c an receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to  indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA Standards.    Throughout the  standards, the use of annotati on marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs.    Students with Disabilities    Children with disabilities and their typically developing peers are all capable of learning, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Children with disabilities need specially designed  instruction and related  services designed to address their disability and ensure their participation in age appropriate activities  with  typically- developing  peers. Each child with a disability has an individualized educational program  (IEP) which documents   his/her individual goals, supports, and services as determined by his/her needs,  strengths, and abilities. These individual supports, accommodations, and services are designed to assist the  child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning standards. With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences with their  typically- developing   peers and be held to the same high standards and expectations as those without disabilities.

Students  should be exposed to and prompted to produce writing for a range of purposes (to entertain, to explain, to  persuade). These text types including narratives (retellings of events they have experienced or fictional  stories) as   well as responses to narratives, pieces of expository writing (shopping lists and  notes/letters/pictures to classmates or adults in the community), and informational texts (such as ‘how - to’  books, and diagrams and pictures that generate, represent, or exp ress information).    Conceptualized broadly, these writing experiences for our youngest learners should include opportunities  to narrate or dictate their stories and ideas to an adult who is writing it down, draw and illustrate their  ideas, especially makin g connections from read - alouds to writing.

As children are gaining  mastery of the Standards in 3rd grade, some students may requir e support to demonstrate skills .   Range of Student Reading Experiences   for  3 rd   Grade   Students in 3rd grade should  experience a balance of literature and informational texts in the context of  instruction designed to create opportunities for children to engage with a variety of topics and texts, and  have discussions about texts that support language development and know ledge building. Creating this  learning environment can take a variety of formats, including read - alouds, shared readings, paired  readings, learning activities that incorporate literacy materials, talking, writing and other literacy  activities.    We refer to   these instructional events as ‘reading or literacy experiences’ because the focus is on  using texts, printed and visual, to develop readers’ concepts of how meaning is conveyed through reading  and writing, and in turn their ability to make meaning of increasingly complex text. Much of this work is  done through talk - reading and reading - writing connections.   The following are examples of literary and informational text types that could be used in classroom  instruction. Texts are not limited to these examples.     LITERATURE:   stories, drama, poetry, fiction, fairytales, folk tales, tall tales, and other literary texts .  INFORMATIONAL TEXT :   nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles about science,  art, history, social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print and  digital  sources . 

New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 46   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT   Text Complexity Expectations for  3 rd   Grade   Students in  3 rd   grade are at varying stages of development as word readers and as text comprehenders .   By  the end of the school year, however, students in  3rd  grade should have good control of word reading skills  and be developing reading comprehension strategies in order to read appropriately complex literary and  informational texts at or above grade le vel. To bolster students’ text comprehension skills, teachers should  provide large group, small group, and individual reading activities, with materials that are content - rich and  complex at age - appropriate levels. Students should also participate in interactive read - aloud discussions of  more complex texts that may not be readily accessible to students when reading independently. It is the  case that students are refining their word reading and comprehension skills as they experience more  challenging texts; t herefore it is essential that even while students read texts at an instruction and  independent level, they are also scaffolded into reading texts at or above grade - level — through read -alouds,  discussion, reading - writing connections, etc. Because each reader   brings different skills and background  knowledge to the act of reading, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible to a peer in the  same classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to allow all  stu dents to access grade - level texts.  The most critical distinction, however, is the distinction between  the complexity of the texts used for children to work on their word reading accuracy and fluency,  and the complexity of the texts used to build up languag e and knowledge.     English Language Learners/Multilingual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the school system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic   competencies in their  home or primary language.    While building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.    The eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) standards is to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home  or primary languages to  indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA Standards.    Throughout the  Standards, the use of annotation marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs.      S tudents with Disabilities Children with disabilities and their typically developing peers are all capable of learning, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Children with disabilities need specially designed instruction and related  services designed to address their disabil ity and ensure their participation in age appropriate activities  with  typically- developing  peers. Each child with a disability has an individualized educational program  (IEP) which documents his/her individual goals, supports, and services as determined by   his/her needs,  strengths, and abilities. These individual supports, accommodations, and services are designed to assist the  child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning standards. With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences with their  typically- developing   peers and be held to the same high standards and expectations as those without disabilities.

Students in 3 rd   grade will write for multiple purposes (to entertain, to explain, to persuade) and learn about  various tools (print and digital) to produce, share, and publish writing. In all writing tasks, students will  learn to use and to adjust language to best communicate ideas, content, and message to readers; that is,  third graders should be practicing enacting the distinction between conversational and academic language  and their purposes and use.    Stu dents’ academic language skills, including written language, co - develop with content and world  knowledge and through opportunities to read, write, and discuss with peers. As part of their writing  development, students should continue to learn about how tec hnology and digital tools for writing can  increase learning and communication (e.g., use technology to write and explore concepts). Students should  receive instruction in keyboarding, with a focus on technique over speed.

In all writing tasks, students will  learn to use and to adjust language to best communicate ideas, content, and message to readers; that is,  fourth graders should be clear on the distinction between conversational and academic language and their  purposes and use — and beginning to master some of the conventions of academic language at grade - appropriate level s.     Students’ academic language skills, including written language, co - develop with content and world  knowledge and through opportunities to read, write, and discuss with peers. As part of their writing  development, students should continue to learn about   how technology and digital tools for writing can  increase learning and communication. Students should receive instruction in keyboarding, with a focus on  technique over speed.

As children are gaining  mastery of the standards in 5 th   grade, some students may requir e support to demonstrate skills .   Range of Student Reading Experiences   for  5 th   Grade   Students in 5th grade should experience a balance of literature and informational texts   in the context of  instruction designed to create opportunities for children to engage with a variety of topics and texts, and  have discussions about texts that support language development and knowledge building. Creating this  learning environment for rea ders can take a variety of formats, including read - alouds, shared readings,  paired readings, independent readings and other learning activities that incorporate literacy materials,  talking, and writing. We refer to these instructional events as ‘reading or   literacy experiences’ because the  focus is on using texts, printed and visual, to develop readers’ concepts of how meaning is conveyed  through reading and writing, and in turn their ability to make meaning of increasingly complex text. Much  of this work i s done through talk - reading and reading - writing connections.   The following are examples of literary and informational text types that could be used in classroom  instruction. Texts are not limited to these examples.   LITERATURE:   stories, drama, poetry, fiction, fairytales, folk tales, tall tales, and other literary texts .  INFORMATIONAL TEXT :   nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles about science,  art, history, social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both pr int and digital  sources.   

New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017) 64   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT   Text Complexity Expectations for 5 th   Grade   By the end of the school year, 5 th   grade students will read and comprehend literary and informational texts  at or above grade level. As in the early grades, though perhaps less striking, there still needs to be a  distinction between the complexity of the texts used for children to work on  their independent  comprehension skills, and the complexity of the texts used as part of teacher - led classroom instruction and  units of study to build up their language and knowledge. Because each reader brings different skills and  background knowledge to t he act of reading, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible to a  peer in the same classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to  allow all students to access complex texts.   English Language Learne rs/Multilingual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the school system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary la nguage.   While building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.   The eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) st andards is to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to  indicate mastery of   the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA standards.   Throughout the  standards, the use of annotation marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs.    Students with Disabilities   Children with disabilities and their typically developing peers are all capable   of learning, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Children with disabilities need specially designed instruction and related  services designed to address their disability and ensure their participation in age appropriate activities  with  typically- developing  peers. Each child with a disability has an individualized educational program  (IEP) which documents his/her individual goals, supports, and services as determined by his/her needs,  strengths, and abilities. These individual supports, accommodations, and services are designed to assist the  child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning standards. With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences with their  typically- de veloping   peers and be held to the same high standards and expectations as those without disabilities.

Students in 6 th   grade will write for multiple purposes (to entertain, to explain, to persuade) and learn about  various tools (print and digital) to produce, share, and publish writing. In all writing tasks, students will  learn to use and to adjust language to best communicate ideas, content, and message to readers; that is, 6th  graders should be clear on the distinction between conversational and academic language and their  purposes and use — they should be abl e to move between the registers and show mastery of some of the  conventions of academic language.     Students’ academic language skills, including written language, co - develop with content and world  knowledge and through opportunities to read, write, and discuss with peers. As part of their writing  development, students should continue to learn about how  technology and digital tools for writing can  increase learning and communication.

As children are gaining  mastery of the standards in 7 th   grade, some students may requir e support to demonstrate skills .  Range of Student Reading Experiences  f or 7 th   Grade   Students in 7 th   grade should experience a balance of literature and informational texts designed to create  opportunities for learners to engage with a variety of topics and texts, and have discussions about texts that  support language development and knowledge building. Creating this learning environment for readers can  take a variety of formats, including shared readings, paired readings, independent readings and o ther  learning activities that incorporate literacy materials, talking, and writing. We refer to these instructional  events as ‘reading or literacy experiences’ because the focus is on using texts, printed and visual, to develop  readers’ concepts of how mea ning is conveyed through reading and writing, and in turn their ability to  make meaning of increasingly complex text. Much of this work is done through talk - reading and reading - writing connections.   The following are examples of literary and informational t ext types that could be used in classroom  instruction. Texts are not limited to these examples.    LITERATURE:   stories, drama, poetry, fiction, myths, graphic novels, and other literary texts.   INFORMATIONAL TEXT:   nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles about science,  art, history, social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print and digital  sources.

Though less striking than in the earlier grades, there still needs to be a  distinction between the complexity of the texts used for children to work on their independent   comprehension skills, and the complexity of the texts used as part of teacher - led classroom instruction and  units of study to build up their language and knowledge.    Because each reader brings different skills and  background knowledge to the act of reading, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible to a  peer in the same classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to  allow all stude nts to access grade - level texts .  English Language Learners/Multiling ual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the school system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary language.    Whi le building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.    The eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) standards is   to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to  indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA standards.    Throughout the  standards, the use of annotation marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs.    Students with Disabilities   Children with disabilities and their typically developing peers are all capable of learn ing, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Children with disabilities need specially designed instruction and related  services designed to address their disability and ensure their participation in age appropriate activities  with  typically-developi ng  peers. Each child with a disability has an individualized educational program  (IEP) which documents his/her individual goals, supports, and services as determined by his/her needs,  strengths, and abilities. These individual supports, accommodations, and   services are designed to assist the  child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning standards. With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences with their  typically- developing   peers and be held to the same high standards and expectations as those without disabilities.

With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences with their  typically- developing   pe ers and be held to the same high standards and expectatio ns as those without disabilities .

Students in 8 th   grade will write for multiple purposes (to entertain, to explain, to persuade) and learn about  various tools (print and digital) to produce, share, and publish writing. In all writing tasks, students will  learn to use and to adjust language to best communicate ideas, content, and message to readers; that is, 8 th   graders should be clear on the distinction between conversational and academic language and their  purposes and use — they should be a ble to move between the registers and show mastery of many of the  conventions of academic language.     Students’ academic language skills, including written language, co - develop with content and world  knowledge and through opportunities to read, write, and  discuss with peers. As part of their writing  development, students should continue to learn about how technology and digital tools for writing can  increase learning and communication. Students should continue to improve keyboarding skills to increase  speed   and accuracy.

As children are gaining  mastery of the standards in 9 th - 10 th   grade, some students may requir e support to demonstrate skills .   Range of Student Reading Ex periences for 9 th - 10 th   Grade   Students in 9 th   and 10 th   grades should experience a balance of literature and informational texts in the  context of instruction designed to create opportunities for learners to engage with a variety of topics, texts,  and in discussions about  texts that support language development and knowledge building. Creating this  learning environment for readers can take a variety of formats, including shared readings, paired readings,  independent readings and other learning activities that incorporate li teracy materials, talking, and writing.  We refer to these instructional events as ‘reading or literacy experiences’ because the focus is on using  texts, printed and visual, to develop readers’ concepts of how meaning is conveyed through reading and  writing , and in turn their ability to make meaning of increasingly complex text. Much of this work is done  through talk - reading and reading - writing connections.   The following are examples of literary and informational text types that could be used in classroom  in struction. Texts are not limited to these examples.     LITERATURE:   stories, drama, poetry, fiction, myths, graphic novels, and other literary texts.   INFORMATIONAL TEXT:   nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles about science,  art, history,   social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print and digital  sources.        

  New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017)     98   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT     Text Complexity Expectations for  9 th - 10 th   Grade    By the end of the school year, 9 th - 10 th   grade students will read and comprehend literary and informational  texts that are at or above grade level.    Because each reader brings different skills and background  knowledge to the act of reading, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible to a peer in the  same classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to allow all  stude nts to access grade - level texts .  Engli sh Language Learners/Multilingual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) enter the school system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary language.    While building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.    The eventual goal of English La nguage Arts (ELA) standards is to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speaking and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to   indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA standards.    Throughout the  standards, the use of annotation m arks this concept for ELLs/MLLs .   Students with Disabilities   Children with disabilities and their typically developing  peers are all capable of learning, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Children with disabilities need specially designed instruction and related  services designed to address their disability and ensure their participation in age appropriate acti vities  with  typically- developing   peers. Each child with a disability has an individualized educational program  (IEP) which documents his/her individual goals, supports, and services as determined by his/her needs,  strengths, and abilities. These individual   supports, accommodations, and services are designed to assist the  child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning standards. With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences wi th their  typically- developing   peers and be held to the same high standards and expectations as those without disabilities .

  New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017)     107   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT         11 th - 12 th   Grade   English Language Arts  Learning Standards     11 th - 12 th   Grade   Introduction   Guidance and Support   Guidance and support are an integral part of developmentally appropriate practice. As children are gaining  mastery of the standards in 11th - 12th grade, some students may require support to demonstrate skills.   Range of S tudent Reading E xperiences for 11 th  - 12 th   Grade     Students in 11th and 12th grade should experience a balance of literature and informational texts in the  context of instruction designed to create opportunities for learners to engage with a variety of topics and  texts, and   have discussions about texts that support language development and knowledge building.  Creating this learning environment for readers can take a variety of formats, including shared readings,  paired readings, independent readings and other learning activi ties that incorporate literacy materials,  talking, and writing. We refer to these instructional events as ‘reading or literacy experiences’ because the  focus is on using texts, printed and visual, to develop readers’ concepts of how meaning is conveyed  thr ough reading and writing, and in turn their ability to make meaning of increasingly complex text. Much  of this work is done through talk - reading and reading - writing connections.   The following are examples of literary and informational text types that could   be used in classroom  instruction. Texts are not limited to these examples.   LITERATURE:   stories, drama, poetry, fiction, myths, graphic novels, and other literary texts.   INFORMATIONAL TEXT:   nonfiction, biographies, autobiographies, books and articles about   science,  art, history, social studies, and information displayed in charts, graphs, or maps, in both print and digital  sources.       

  New York State Education Department     ENGLISH LANGUAGE ART S LEARNING STANDARDS   (2017)     108   NEW YORK STATE    EDUCATION DEPARTMENT     Text Complexity Expectations for  11 th - 12 th   Grade    By the end of the school year, 11th and 12th g rade students will read and comprehend literary and  informational texts that are at or above grade level.    Because each reader brings different skills and  background knowledge to the act of reading, a text that is ‘complex’ for one reader may be accessible   to a  peer in the same classroom. For this reason, educators should provide scaffolding and support as needed to  allow all stude nts to access grade - level text .  English Language Learners/Multilingual Learners   English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Le arners (MLLs) enter the school system at all grade levels,  with a range of proficiency in English and varying degrees of literacy and academic competencies in their  home or primary language.    While building proficiency in English, ELLs/MLLs in English as a   New Language  and Bilingual Education programs may demonstrate skills bilingually or transfer linguistic knowledge  across languages.    The eventual goal of English Language Arts (ELA) standards is to support the lifelong  practices of reading, writing, speak ing and listening in English.    ELLs/MLLs can receive home language  supports and be provided opportunities to demonstrate skills in their home or primary languages to  indicate mastery of the linguistic concepts and skills embedded in the ELA standards.    Thr oughout the  standards, the use of annotation  marks this concept for ELLs/MLLs .   Students with Disabilities   Children with disabilities and their typically developing peers are all capable of learning, achieving, and  making developmental progress. Children w ith disabilities need specially designed instruction and related  services designed to address their disability and ensure their participation in age appropriate activities  with  typically- developing   peers. Each child with a disability has an individualized educational program  (IEP) which documents his/her individual goals, supports, and services as determined by his/her needs,  strengths, and abilities. These individual supports, accommodations, and services are designed to assist the  child to meet the goals in his/her IEP as well as to achieve the learning standards. With the appropriate  services and supports, children with disabilities can participate in experiences with their  typically- developing   peers and be held to the same high standards and expectations   as those without disabilities .      11 GRAD - 12 E S

Students in 11 th   and 12 th   grade will write for multiple purposes (to entertain, to explain , to  persuade) and learn about various tools ( print and digital) to produce, share, and publish writing. In all  writing tasks, students will learn to use and to adjust language to best communicate ideas, content, and  message to readers; that is, 11 th   and 1 2 th   graders should be clear on the distinction between conversational  and academic language and th eir purposes and use — they should be able to move between these registers  and show mastery of the conventions of academic language.    Students’ academic languag e skills, including written language, co - develop with content and world  knowledge and through opportunities to read, write, and discuss with peers. As part of their writing  development, students should continue to learn about how technology and digital too ls for writing can  increase learning and communication.
