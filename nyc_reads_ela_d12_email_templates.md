# READ FIRST (EMAIL Guidance)

# District 12 Email Guidance

## What
➔ Use **aligned templates** for *Before and After each* **Meeting**

## When
➔ Unless otherwise stated emails are to be sent within 24 hours of each meeting
◆ Hours to send emails: **8:00 - 5:00 PM** (*During Schools Days ONLY*)
  - If outside of the named hours Schedule Send for **8:00 AM the next School Day**
  - Do not send emails during school closure (**schedule send for the first date of return**)
    - *Ex: Schedule Send all Emails for Thursday September 25th @ 8:00 AM*

## Teacher Emails

While there is not a provided template for teachers emails, all coaches are to send a follow-up coaching email to teachers/teams after each visit.

◆ The teacher emails follow the same timing guidelines (**send during school hours, on school day**)

◆ Teacher emails are to be sent to teacher teams/groups/individuals and the school administration (**principal or assistant principal or capacity builder are to be CC'd on the email**)

◆ Teacher emails are to include a quick summary of the coaching day
  - Highlights from the coaching day (in classroom support or meetings or both)
  - One area of opportunity and one aligned next step (**this needs be shared and reviewed with teachers prior to sending in an email to clarify and provide support prior to implementation**)
  - Naming the next coaching day and any materials that teachers will need in preparation for it

## Tips/Tricks

1. Ensure that you change anything **highlighted** to reflect your schools information
2. Double check the school's information (*Principal Name, School, Grades Teams, etc..*)
3. Double check for all grammatical errors (*misspelled words, periods, etc…*)
4. Ensure all attachments and links are shared as **everyone can view**
5. Ensure all formats are aligned (**one font style is used for the entire email**)
   - *Ex: Georgia or Sans Serif*
6. **Use AI** to fill in the categories for the Coaching Summary Email (**plug in the necessary information- observation notes, details from the coaching day, and have AI plug the information into the template**)
   - Please note that **AI is a tool that operates using real information, real data, personal notes. It grows and adapts according to inputs however emails, feedback, notes have to match/align/be specific to your coaching at your designated school, sending emails with generic, overarching coaching reflections/feedback is *not permissible* and *not a best practice***
7. Create Email Groups on Gmail to ensure the right people are on the correct emails

# After each coaching session email 1

## E-mail sent to school team after each coaching visit

**Subject Line:** 12 x 214 Coaching Summary (3/2)

Hi Principal De Jesus and 12 x 214

Thank you for the opportunity to spend a productive day of coaching at **12 x 214**. Below is a summary of my visit, including observations, highlights, and next steps.

**Coaching Summary and Highlights**

- **Coaching Day:** Today's coaching sessions focused on Modeling a Cause & Effect lesson and Unpacking and Planning Hearty Questions & Scaffolds using the skills criteria for success.
- **During the model debrief** teacher identified and emphasized strategies that were used to enhance explicit instruction and deepen student discourse.
- **4th Grade teachers** engaged in a learning session focused on, questioning practice, and scaffolding development to refine instructional approaches.

**Coaching Support (Teams/Type of Coaching)**

- **Capacity Builder:** Feedback review, walkthrough debrief, planning support.
- **Ms. R:** Individual coaching (*classroom + planning/internalization*).
- **3rd Grade Team (Ms. H, Mr. K, Ms.R):** Group coaching via content meeting, collaborative internalization and planning.
- **In-the-Moment Coaching:** Provided during live instruction (*Mr. K and Ms.H*)

**Planning Highlight:**

- **4th Grade:** Teachers collaborated to develop hearty questions that promote higher-order thinking and student discussion.
- **2nd Grade:** Cause & Effect modeling demonstrated how to structure explicit instruction by breaking down the "what" (cause) and "why" (effect) using clue words and guided annotations. Teachers captured notes that aligned to explicit instruction model and reflected on execution

**Area(s) to Address**

- **2nd Grade:** Increase student engagement in guided practice and ensure they actively apply the taught skill and share their thinking through discussion.
- **4th Grade:** Strengthen questioning by balancing hearty and scaffolded questions to guide students toward conceptual understanding.

**Bridge to Practice**

**Previous Action Step:** [4th Grade: Teachers will integrate higher order questions. 2nd Grade: Teachers will strengthen the We Do phase by Designing whole-group tasks aligned to the skill ] (**Status: Not Observed**).

**Current Action Step:**
1. **4th Grade:** Teachers will integrate higher-order thinking questions by: creating hearty questions aligned to the skill/standards full demands. This looks like planning question beyond basic recall and identification
2. **2nd Grade:** Teachers will implement a structured We Do during questioning lessons by: 1. Providing specific whole group tasks aligned to the skill 2. Modeling the process to apply the skill 3. Engaging all students in a collaborative task

**Model Template Example:**

**2nd Grade: Instructional Flow**
1. **Launch:** Define cause & effect, activate thinking with real-life examples.
2. **I Do:** Model text annotations, highlight clue words (*because, due to, as a result*).
3. **We Do:** Guide students in identifying cause-effect relationships, reinforcing with targeted questioning.

**Next Steps and Resources**

To sustain and reinforce this work, teachers and the Capacity Builder should:

**Next Steps for teachers:**
- **2nd Grade:** Plan out a we do task using a chunk of text that allows students to apply the skill, discuss their thinking, and practice using the skill
- **4th Grade:** Implement hearty and scaffolded questioning planning, using the skill to ensure students engage in meaningful academic discussions

**Next Steps for Capacity Builder:**
- Observe and provide feedback on lesson execution to ensure questioning and scaffolds are effectively used.
- Support teachers in aligning explicit instruction strategies with lesson objectives.

I look forward to my next coaching day on **3/17** and continuing our work to enhance instructional practices. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or if further clarification is needed.

# After Sustainability Visit

## District E-mail sent to school team after Sustainability Visit (End of Cycle)

**Subject Line:** **12 x 214** Sustainability Visit- End of Cycle 1

Hi **Principal De Jesus and 12 x 214**

Thank you for the opportunity to spend a productive day of coaching at **12 x 214**. Below is a summary of my visit, including observations, highlights, and next steps.

**Sustainability Plan:** **Cycle 2 [12 x 214 Haynes- D12/Teaching Lab Sustainability Plan]**

**Summary and Highlights**

- Across this cycle, coaching support included lesson modeling, co-planning, student work analysis, and structured reflection. Teachers engaged in learning around gradual release, scaffolded and hearty questioning, and aligning small-group instruction to student data.
- **2nd Grade:** Teachers applied explicit instruction strategies, particularly during the "We Do" phase, and incorporated scaffolded questions to strengthen student talk and task clarity.
- **4th Grade:** Teachers improved lesson planning by embedding structured I Do, We Do, and You Do phases and practiced developing questions that support skill mastery.

**Teams Coached:(Teams/Type of Coaching)**

- **Capacity Builder:** Feedback review, walkthrough debrief, planning support.
- **2nd Grade: Ms. R:** Individual coaching (*classroom + planning/internalization*).
- **3rd Grade Team (Ms. H, Mr. K, Ms.R):** Group coaching via content meeting, collaborative internalization and planning. **In-the-Moment Coaching:** Provided during live instruction (*Mr. K and Ms.H*)

**Planning Highlight**

- Teachers used student work to surface misconceptions and adjust instruction in real time.
- Small-group planning became more targeted, with intentional grouping and skill alignment based on I-Ready and classroom data.
- Gradual release strategies became more consistent across both grades.

**Area(s) to Address**

- Teachers continue to build toward ensuring that independent tasks (You Do) fully align with the skill and offer the right level of support for students to demonstrate mastery without over-scaffolding.
- There is also a need for continued refinement of small-group lesson delivery, particularly in closing gaps through flexible, student-responsive planning.

**Bridge to Practice- Cycle Goal:** The Cycle 2 goal was to strengthen Tier 1 instruction through the use of explicit instruction techniques (*I Do, We Do, You Do*) and intentional lesson tailoring in both whole- and small-group settings. The rationale was to ensure instruction supports the learning of the majority of students, particularly in Grades 2 and 4, and leads to measurable growth in proficiency. **Status:** The goal of strengthening Tier 1 instruction through explicit instruction and lesson tailoring has been **partially met**. Growth is evident in planning and delivery of I Do and We Do phases, with students increasingly engaged during instruction. However, further support is needed to ensure transfer to independent work and small-group success. Teachers are continuing to internalize and apply these practices, setting a strong foundation for continued growth. **[Partially Met]**

**Next Steps and Resources**

To sustain and reinforce this work, teachers and the Capacity Builder should:

**Next Steps for Teachers:**
- Refine "You Do" tasks to ensure alignment with the skill and increase opportunities for students to independently apply learning.
- Implement revised small-group instruction plans, ensuring tight alignment between student need, text, and instructional strategy.

**Next Steps for Capacity Builder:**
- Continue supporting teachers in analyzing student work and using it to adjust instruction.
- Facilitate sustainability planning to ensure instructional shifts carry forward into SY25-26.

**Cycle 2**
- Cycle 2 will begin on **Monday, January 5th, 2026**.
  - During this session we will conduct a BOY walkthrough with Administration using the **IPG 1-Pager FSOT**, debrief walkthrough, plan coaching support, review Capacity Builder role, and Naquana will conduct a grade-team meeting
  - **12 x 214** Complete the walkthrough schedule on the **SY 25- 26 12 x47 - Teaching Lab Walkthroughs Cycle 2 Tab** by **Friday January 2nd**

Thank you for your ongoing support throughout this cycle. I look forward to continuing our partnership as we strengthen instructional practices and student outcomes across the grade level for Cycle 2.
