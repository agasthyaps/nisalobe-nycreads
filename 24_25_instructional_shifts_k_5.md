## Introduction

New York City is known for its diversity. Our school population is made up of just under 1 million students, and our focus is to serve our school population and provide them what they need to be ready for the world of college and/or career. Racial demographics for NYC's student population are:

| ASIAN | BLACK | HISPANIC | WHITE |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| 16.6% | 24.4% | 41.1% | 14.7% |

**Source: DOE Data at a Glance**

NYC READS is an intentional decision by New York City Public Schools to make a difference in outcomes for all of the students in our school system. While the Covid 19 pandemic impacted proficiency rates, especially for those in marginalized communities, in a negative way, the challenges existed and persisted before the pandemic started. The data below represents the 2019 proficiency ratings for students in grades 3-8:

| ASIAN | BLACK | HISPANIC | WHITE |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| 49.2% | 18.1% | 18.3% | 49.4% |

**Source: Equity NYC - ELA Proficiency Data**

When students exit high school, whether they elect to attend college or pursue a career, they need to be able to read and understand a wide variety of complex texts. The City University of New York (CUNY) administers an assessment for entering freshmen annually. These tests allow CUNY schools to gauge if students have met their standards for college readiness in English and Math. The table below shows CUNY's 2020 college readiness data:

| ASIAN | BLACK | HISPANIC | WHITE |
|-------|-------|----------|-------|
| 78.2% | 49.2% | 49.2% | 74.7% |

Though there are many factors that may impact our students' educational trajectory, one factor resting squarely in the locus of control of our education system is the capacity to teach children to read proficiently. The data makes a clear case for why we, as educators, must shift to research-based approaches to ensure all of our students are getting the skills they need in order to be set-up for academic success.

### What is the Science of Reading?

The science of reading is a vast body of scientifically based research about reading and issues related to reading and writing, focused on five main components: phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. These components require systematic, explicit, and cumulative instruction. An alignment between reading assessments, core instruction and intervention will result in improved student outcomes for all learners.

Science of reading is not an ideology or philosophy, a fad or trend, a one-sized-fits-all approach, a specific program of instruction, or a single component of instruction, such as phonics.

The goal of science-based reading instruction is for students to be able to read any book of their interest. The instructional shifts we are recommending are meant to empower all to become strong, thriving readers. It's crucial to note that these shifts are not in opposition to helping students develop and nurture a joy for reading. In fact, research is clear that unless students are explicitly taught foundational skills and have plentiful opportunities to build background knowledge and vocabulary, they will not have access to a wide variety of texts and will therefore be unable to discover joy, wonder or solace in books. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten says it beautifully, "Still, there is joy in this work—whether reading aloud stories and poems that delight young and old, or introducing the wonder of new words and ideas to children. Ultimately, the science of reading is inextricably linked to the love of reading. To teach and inspire the next generation, we simply can't have one without the other." Therefore, in addition to the eight literacy shifts named here, schools and classrooms should also maintain robust libraries and library systems, find space and time for student choice, celebrate students' reading and writing accomplishments, and partner with families on reading routines that can be implemented at home.

NYC READS is our commitment to getting literacy right the first time and providing our students with the keys to be able to unlock the kind of future they have imagined for themselves. We are committed to shifting our approach and curricula as a means to provide access to 100% of our student population.

## The Shifts

To support implementation of practices aligned to the science of reading, New York City Public Schools recommends the following shifts in classroom instruction for Grades K - 5. These shifts are not meant to be exhaustive but highlight high-leverage practices that will enhance literacy instruction.

*Further guidance for each shift, including curricular examples and additional resources will be available during Summer 2024.

### From These Common Literacy Practices → To These Science of Reading-Informed Practices

| FROM THESE COMMON LITERACY PRACTICES | TO THESE SCIENCE OF READING-INFORMED PRACTICES |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Non-systematic, incidental instruction in phonics | Systematic, explicit phonics instruction |
| Use of leveled texts (K-2) | Use of decodable texts (K-2) |
| Leveled reading groups | Small group, differentiated instruction based on need |
| Incidental instruction and practice in fluency | Explicit instruction and practice in fluency |
| Assessing reading with running records | Assessing reading with universal screening, secondary diagnostics, and additional formative assessments |
| Inconsistent access to high-quality curricular materials | Adoption of research-based, high-quality curricula |
| Skills-based instruction | Direct, explicit instruction in service of comprehension |
| Non-systematic writing instruction in isolation | Explicit, systematic and cumulative writing instruction, integrated with reading |

---

## Shift 1: Systematic, Explicit Phonics Instruction

Phonics refers to a form of instruction that teaches students the sound-spelling relationships and their use to decode and spell words (Ehri, 2022). Systematic, explicit phonics instruction includes concepts that are directly explained and skills that are clearly modeled by the teacher (Honig, 2013). There is a high level of teacher-student interaction with prompt corrective feedback promoting active participation. Implementing a systematic approach means that skills and concepts are taught in a logical order with important prerequisite skills taught first. Cumulative practice and ongoing review of previously learned skills are built in so that skills are retained and automaticity is developed (Spear-Swerling, 2018).

### From Incidental Phonics → To Systematic, Explicit Phonics

| FROM INCIDENTAL PHONICS | TO SYSTEMATIC, EXPLICIT PHONICS |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| • Teaches concepts and skills indirectly | • Teaches concepts and skills directly through modeling and explanation with examples and non-examples; corrective feedback is provided through high levels of student-teacher interaction |
| • Teaches whole words as they are encountered in text and sound-spelling correspondences are inferred | • Teaches sound-spelling correspondences explicitly and in a logical progression, from simple to more complex |
| • Encourages memorizing high frequency words | • Teaches high frequency words through letter-sound connections, to the extent that they apply, for both regularly and irregularly spelled words |
| • Introduces prerequisite skills inconsistently | • Introduces prerequisite skills first |
| • Provides inadequate or inconsistent cumulative practice and review | • Includes cumulative practice and ongoing review |
| • Offers limited application of taught skills | • Practices and applies taught skills extensively |
| • Teaches the three-cueing system (meaning, structure/syntax, and visual cues) to identify unfamiliar words | • Teaches to carefully examine each part of the word, stay focused on the print and segment and blend all the sounds together when encountering unknown words in text |
| • Uses word walls to memorize high frequency words | • Uses sound walls to attend to phonemes, articulation and sound-spelling connections when learning high frequency words |

## Shift 2: Use of Decodable Texts in K-2

Decodable texts are designed to help students achieve phonics mastery. According to research, decodable texts can improve decoding accuracy, a crucial skill for word recognition (Mesmer, 2005). The National Reading Panel (2000) advocates for educators to teach phonics explicitly and systematically and provide students with opportunities to practice these skills in context. Decodable texts are an important scaffold for beginning readers, however they are not the only type of text students should be exposed to. Beginning readers also need to engage with authentic texts which build vocabulary and content knowledge.

### From Leveled Texts in K-2 → To Decodable Texts in K-2

| FROM LEVELED TEXTS IN K-2 | TO DECODABLE TEXTS IN K-2 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| • Contains words with phonic elements that have not necessarily been taught and therefore does not support development of phonics skills | • Contains words that can mostly be sounded out based on the phonics skills previously taught |
| • Provides a wide disparity at the same reading level; two level D books can contain words with very different phonic elements | • Helps develop phonological decoding skills through the design and sequence of controlling words that appear in the text |
| • Reinforces the use of context and word-guessing strategies | • Provides decoding practice needed to master targeted phonics skills |

## Shift 3: Small Group, Differentiated Instruction Based on Need

Small group, differentiated reading instruction provides an opportunity for teachers to target students' literacy needs. Research states grouping should be a dynamic, flexible practice with instruction determined by student needs and students' entry into and exit from specific groups determined by their progress (NICHD, 2000). Many teachers in their classrooms use running records and group students according to reading levels. However, evidence shows that running records do not meet the traditionally expected psychometric standards of reliability and validity, compromising instructional decision-making (Fawson, 2006). Additionally, there is little scientific research to support using leveled texts to improve reading achievement. Instead of leveled reading groups, such as guided reading, it is best to use screener, diagnostic, and progress monitoring data to identify student need, group students according to that need (not level) and provide explicit, targeted instruction (Puzio et.al., 2020, Young. 2022). Universal screeners are valid and reliable tools that help to identify students who may be at-risk for reading difficulties and will benefit from early intervention to create better learning opportunities (Miles et.al., 2016). Small group instruction can focus on any of the components of literacy instruction:

- Phonological Awareness
- Phonics
- Spelling
- Handwriting (K, 1)
- High-Frequency Words
- Fluency
- Vocabulary
- Comprehension
- Writing

### From Leveled Reading Groups → To Small Group, Differentiated Instruction Based on Need

| FROM LEVELED READING GROUPS | TO SMALL GROUP, DIFFERENTIATED INSTRUCTION BASED ON NEED |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| • Uses reading levels to form groups, as identified by a running record assessment | • Uses screener, diagnostic, curriculum-based formative assessment, and/or progress monitoring data to form groups based on need |
| • Makes text selections based on student reading level | • Utilizes curricular materials based on student need |
| • Provides instruction that may or may not address student need since students at the same reading level may have different strengths and areas to target | • Provides systematic, explicit, and highly interactive instruction that teaches key skills and concepts based on student need |

## Shift 4: Explicit Instruction and Practice in Fluency

Fluency is the reading of texts with accuracy, automaticity and prosody. It is a critical, but often neglected component of skilled reading. Fluency acts as a bridge between word recognition and comprehension. Non-fluent readers use valuable cognitive energies to move through a text rather than focus on comprehension (Hasbrouck and Glaser, 2019). According to Hudson, Lane and Pullen (2005), "struggling readers may not gain reading fluency incidentally or automatically. In contrast to skilled readers, they often need direct instruction in how to read fluently and sufficient opportunities for intense, fluency-focused practice…" In order to continue to grow as a reader, students need explicit instruction and time to practice fluent reading.

| FROM INCIDENTAL INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICE IN FLUENCY | TO EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION AND PRACTICE IN FLUENCY |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| • Utilizes less explicit methods, such as increasing the amount of independent or recreational reading | • Utilizes teacher-guided, repeated oral reading procedures with feedback |
| • Limits students' oral reading practice by using approaches such as Round Robin or Popcorn Reading | • Implements effective procedures, such as repeated reading, echo reading, paired reading, choral reading, and performance reading (i.e., readers theater or radio reading) |

## Shift 5: Using Universal Screeners and Secondary Diagnostics to Identify Reading Strengths and Areas for Growth

Universal screeners are brief, efficient, valid, and reliable tools that can identify students who may be at-risk for reading difficulties (Miles et.al., 2016). All students are administered screeners three times per year. The data is analyzed and interpreted to make educational decisions for core instruction. Screening uses measures that serve as indicators of a broader set of reading skills: phonemic awareness, basic and advanced phonics skills, fluency, and comprehension. Secondary diagnostics help determine what students understand to build on the student's strengths and address their specific needs in the domains of word recognition and language comprehension (Spear-Swerling, 2016). Instructional support and progress monitoring are tailored to meet students' needs. A comprehensive assessment system is critical to effectively analyze and interpret relevant data to inform instruction supporting the ongoing needs of striving readers and writers.

### From Running Records → To Universal Screeners, Secondary Diagnostics, and Additional Formative Assessments

| FROM RUNNING RECORDS | TO UNIVERSAL SCREENERS, SECONDARY DIAGNOSTICS, AND ADDITIONAL FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • Diverges from the standards of reliability and validity; not brief or efficient | **Universal Screener** • Meets the standards of reliability and validity; brief and efficient • Determines if students are on track for meeting grade level outcomes in reading and literacy skills • Interprets scores relative to benchmark criterion under timed conditions • Uses field-tested and empirically evaluated passages for oral reading fluency (beginning mid 1st grade); prerequisite skills have been taught |
| • Determines students' instructional reading level based on a predictable or leveled text | **Secondary Diagnostics** • Administered based on screener and other data points • Provides an in-depth understanding of the student's literacy needs |
| • Interprets scores subjectively; conditions are untimed | **Formative Assessments** • Provides evidence of literacy growth and mastery of taught skills and strategies through progress monitoring, weekly/unit assessments, checks for understanding, oral reading assessments, student writing, etc. |
| • Utilizes predictable or leveled passages; prerequisite skills may not have been taught | |
| • Uses one reading assessment to measure both decoding and language comprehension; difficult to determine the cause of students' literacy needs | |

## Shift 6: Adoption of Research-Based, High-Quality Curricula

Experts agree that one of the best ways to ensure all students have access to high-quality, grade-level literacy learning is through standardized, research-based curricula across all subject areas (Lesaux et.al., 2016; Fisher et.al., 2021). High-quality curricula offers students, including multilingual learners and students with disabilities, the opportunity to systematically develop foundational reading and writing skills, engage with knowledge building content, experience culturally relevant, diverse, complex texts and includes explicit instruction in research-based reading comprehension and writing practices. Use of a shared, research-based curricula also ensures vertical and horizontal alignment and a common language and understanding for teachers, service providers, support staff and school leaders.

### From Skills-Based Curriculum → To Content-Rich Curriculum

| FROM SKILLS-BASED CURRICULUM | TO CONTENT-RICH CURRICULUM |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| • Uses materials from a variety of sources | • Uses research-based, tier 1 core curricular materials |
| • Results in lack of alignment and coherence across grades | • Provides a coherent progression of knowledge and skills (scope & sequence) |
| • Uses checks for understanding and assessments for instructional decision-making inconsistently | • Includes curriculum-based formative and summative assessments for instructional decision-making |
| • Offers unpredictable scaffolds and supports | • Embeds scaffolds and supports for English language learners and readers at all levels, including students with disabilities |
| • Selects texts based on skills or independent student levels | • Selects texts to build shared knowledge and language |
| • Utilizes texts that are unrelated in regard to theme or topic which inhibits the building of background knowledge | • Utilizes text sets that are connected to a unit's theme or topic; builds background knowledge and vocabulary |

## Shift 7: Direct, Explicit Instruction in Service of Comprehension

One of the most important factors to strengthen reading comprehension is to teach knowledge and vocabulary relating to a topic. When it comes to improving reading comprehension, strategy instruction may have an upper limit, but building background knowledge does not; the more students know, the broader the range of texts they can comprehend (Willingham, 2014). Additionally, without knowledge of word meanings, students will have limited comprehension of a text. To ensure all students are able to make meaning of grade-level texts, texts must be evaluated to inform planning, instruction and accessibility. Background knowledge and vocabulary must be explicitly taught, along with verbal reasoning, language structure and literacy knowledge.

[Image: Black and white photograph of a child reading a book]

### From Skills-Based Instruction → To Direct, Explicit Instruction for Accessibility and Comprehension

| FROM SKILLS-BASED INSTRUCTION | TO DIRECT, EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION FOR ACCESSIBILITY AND COMPREHENSION |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • Focuses on isolated teaching of skills that may not develop understanding of a topic | • Focuses on knowledge to support and deepen comprehension with skill work embedded |
| • Emphasizes use of context clues to figure out unfamiliar words with little explicit instruction | • Intentionally selects vocabulary words to either be explicitly taught prior to reading, or indirectly taught during reading |
| • Lacks instruction focused on language structures and verbal reasoning | • Teaches students how to determine word meanings independently (context clues, morphology/structural analysis, use of dictionary) explicitly |
| • Teaches literacy knowledge implicitly | • Includes intentional, purposeful grammar and sentence-level instruction |
| | • Provides direct instruction in making inferences |
| | • Teaches print awareness and text structure explicitly |

## Shift 8: Explicit, Systematic and Cumulative Writing Instruction, Integrated with Reading

Reading and writing rely on common knowledge and skills, despite the fact that historically, they have been taught separately (Kim, 2020; Kim & Graham, 2022). Learning to write, just like learning to read, is not a natural process. To ensure that all students become skilled writers, we need to provide explicit, systematic instruction, with many opportunities for practice and feedback, while also making connections between reading, writing and content knowledge.

In the early grades, handwriting fluency is critical in preparing students for reading acquisition (James, 2012), and it is shown to improve oral language, writing quality and quantity, planning, thinking, and learning (Berninger, 2012; Graham & Santangelo, 2012; Peverly, 2012).

### From Non-Systematic Writing Instruction in Isolation → To Explicit, Systematic and Cumulative Writing Instruction, Integrated with Reading

| FROM NON-SYSTEMATIC WRITING INSTRUCTION IN ISOLATION | TO EXPLICIT, SYSTEMATIC AND CUMULATIVE WRITING INSTRUCTION, INTEGRATED WITH READING |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| • Focuses on content-neutral tasks | • Deepens students' connections to content through writing |
| • Teaches grammar, punctuation, spelling and handwriting incidentally through "editing" | • Provides explicit, systematic instruction in transcription, syntax, text structure and craft |
| • Separates reading and writing instruction | • Integrates reading and writing |
| • Emphasizes personal experience and story generation over other genres | • Emphasizes diversity of writing experiences |

### Throughout Elementary School:

- **Students need time to write about the texts they read.** This includes writing notes about text, answering questions about text in writing, and/or creating and answering written questions about text.

- **Teachers need to explicitly teach students to write.** This includes teaching spelling as well as teaching the process of writing, text structures for writing, and paragraph and sentence construction skills.

- **Schools need to increase how much students write.** This includes increasing how frequently students produce their own texts across genres and topics. (Graham & Perin, 2007; Graham & Hebert, 2010)
