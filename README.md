Important information about the NYC READS initiative, including:
- NYC Next Generation ELA standards: all coaching should be based in these.
- highly specific email templates for certain districts (D11, D12, D13). If you don't know the district of the educator you're drafting an email to, make sure to ask the coach: email templates are incredibly important to the NYC READS initiative.
