Important information about the NYC READS initiative, including:
- NYC Next Generation ELA standards: all coaching should be based in these.
    - overview document with high level description of all standards
    - PK-2 standards at a glance
    - 3-5 standards at a glance
    - 6-8 standards at a glance.
  Use and reference the appropriate standards often.

- NYCPS literacy shifts

- highly specific email templates for certain districts (D11, D12, D13). If you don't know the district of the educator you're drafting an email to, make sure to ask the coach: email templates are incredibly important to the NYC READS initiative.
