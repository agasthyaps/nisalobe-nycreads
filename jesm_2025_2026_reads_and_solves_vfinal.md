## New York City Reads and New York City Solves Our Vision and Instructional Focus for SY25-26:

**The vision for New York City Public Schools is to ensure all students graduate with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to succeed in their careers and communities.**

To support this vision, dramatically strengthen education, and streamline and strengthen curricular resources across the city, New York City Public Schools (NYCPS) is focusing classroom instruction in Literacy (K-8) and Mathematics (6-12) on a set of proven, research-based curricula, backed by intensive Job-Embedded Support provided by a vendor partner organization for educators, school leaders, and district teams.

In alignment with the vision for New York City Public Schools, this work continues to expand across the city in order to broaden impact on the student experience in math and literacy citywide.

In the early stages of the rollout of High-Quality Instructional Materials (HQIM) in New York City, the focus has been on materials use and teacher practice. Now, as NYC Reads and NYC Solves prepares to enter the third year of implementation, we are at a pivotal moment to ensure this work achieves student-level impact over the long term. A national study from TNTP tells us that of 28,000 public elementary and middle schools where the average student was not yet on grade level, just 5% of schools helped the average student catch up. Schools where the average student was not yet on grade level and grew more than 1.3 relative grade levels over an extended period of time were coined **trajectory-changing schools**. The research uncovered hundreds of trajectory-changing schools across the country, but no trajectory-changing systems. New York City's call to action as a system in the year(s) ahead is to become the first **trajectory-changing system**.

**Trajectory-changing schools harness three key ingredients: belonging, consistency, and coherence.** Our shared curriculum is the floor for achieving **consistency**. But a narrow focus on strong, evidence-based instructional practices is what will allow us to reduce variability to ensure consistent, high-quality instruction that leads to outcomes for students.

The power of NYC Reads and NYC Solves is tied to this shared, **consistent** foundation that enables NYCPS to reimagine how we work together across schools, districts, and the entire ecosystem. Over the past 2 years, we have pushed the starting line forward through **shared language and aligned materials** across the system, – laying the foundation for greater cross-district collaboration and collective impact.

NYC Reads and NYC Solves have set us on a shared path and destination. Now, to achieve our goal of **trajectory-changing growth**, we will be laser-focused on a narrow set of evidence-based practices in service of our instructional focus:

[Image: Box containing "NYC Reads and Solves Instructional Vision for 25-26 SY" with subtitle "Centering Student Thinking: Grade-Level Content, Every Student, Every Day"]

This focus builds on our early success and momentum by narrowing in on what we know is most important to get to student-level impact and represents what is common and most important across the instructional shifts in literacy (K-5, 6-8) and math.

NYC Reads and Solves gives us the ability to identify and spread what works in service of this focus by building cross-sector capacity that is laser-focused on achieving our goals for students in literacy and math. Job-Embedded Support (JES) is a key part of our ecosystem of support to help us meet these ambitious goals through these focus areas.

## What is Job-Embedded Support?

### WHAT IS JOB-EMBEDDED SUPPORT?

> Job-Embedded Support is defined as building capacity in groups of educators at all levels of our school system (district teams, school leaders, teachers) through cycles of professional learning that build shared understanding of high-quality instructional materials (HQIM). This process helps teams internalize HQIM in order to operationalize NYCPS instructional shifts, apply research-based best practices, and build sustainable, team-based structures that center student thinking and meet the needs of all students, including multilingual and English language learners (MLs/ELLs), students with disabilities, and those in bilingual settings.

### How Job-Embedded Support Differs from Traditional Coaching: Sustainability through Capacity Building at All Levels

Job-Embedded Support (JES) differs from traditional coaching in key ways:

**Building capacity for teams as opposed to individuals:** Traditional coaching provides one-on-one support tailored to an individualized teacher's goal. In contrast, JES builds capacity for groups of teachers to collaboratively internalize and implement HQIM, and the pedagogical practices that help them to do so, to meet the needs of all students.

**A sustained focus on building capacity:** Unlike traditional coaching, which can be a permanent support system within a district, JES is time-bound and is focused on building capacity at all levels of the system, with the goal to support the creation of sustainable structures that lead to collective implementation of a shared curriculum. *Sustainable capacity building through JES has a goal of ensuring that schools and districts will be set up for success to continue to lead in this work without the support of an external partner, and is a critical focus of JES.*

Additionally, JES is collaborative, leveraging existing school communities to implement NYCPS Instructional Shifts through HQIM. Over time, JES intentionally shifts responsibility from the facilitator to educators, who take increasing ownership of sustaining strong instructional practices. JES is one part of a broader support system for NYC Reads and NYC Solves that also includes citywide professional learning for educators, school leaders, and district staff.

## Vision For Job-Embedded Support:

Districts and schools receiving Job-Embedded Support from vendor partners as part of the NYC Reads and NYC Solves will receive support focused on ensuring that sustainable knowledge, systems, structures, and skills are built, resulting in longevity and impact beyond the initial launch years. JES requires deep collaboration at all levels of the system. Specifically:

- Collaboration between support providers and central office teams to increase consistency and coherence of support across districts.
- Collaboration between support providers and district leadership teams focused on identifying district-level priorities for support (in service of the city-wide instructional focus areas, operationalizing supports across schools, aligning necessities and follow-ups between district and school support, and building sustainable practices).
- Collaboration with school leadership teams focused on operationalizing supports within schools and building school-based capacity that will allow work to sustain beyond partner engagement.
- Collaboration between vendors partnering with the same districts and schools focused on ensuring alignment of support across stakeholders and creating a cohesive experience for all stakeholders in alignment with citywide instructional focus areas and guidance.
- Partnership with teams of teachers to build sustainable knowledge, skills, practices, and structures by engaging in cycles of support.

Through this multi-level, coherent, Job-Embedded Support, teachers, school leaders, district leaders, and central office leaders will build knowledge and skills in their content areas, aligned pedagogical approaches and curricular materials, and the systems and structures that will sustain those approaches and lead to lasting student impact.

## NYCPS Central Leadership Collaboration:

The NYCPS Central Leadership teams and their partners (including TNTP) are a critical lever in managing the historic levels of change within this work. The collaboration between NYCPS Central and Job Embedded Support partners is crucial to ensuring that key content, guidance, and expectations are shared across the city in an aligned manner. This collaboration begins with the launch of the year at Vendor Summer Institute, where new and returning support providers will have the opportunity to unpack and engage with this key content, guidance, and expectations. This collaboration will continue throughout the year, through check-ins, on-site shadow visits, and regular meetings of the respective Communities of Practice for NYC Reads and Solves. Specific meeting cadences and frequencies for respective communities can be found here. Central Leadership teams and their partners will also support HQIM implementation by:

- Working closely with district and school leaders, and vendors to ensure messaging, guidance, and expectations are aligned and coherent throughout the school year, reinforcing key priorities for both NYC Reads and Solves.
- Designing and facilitating an annual Vendor Summer Institute experience, ensuring that all support providers and stakeholders are able to engage with key content, guidance, and expectations, and are well-prepared to turnkey the information to their teams for a successful school year.

Support providers will partner with district leadership teams to:

- Develop a strong working relationship with the District Superintendent and their team.
- Collaborate with the district leadership team to develop a district-wide strategic implementation plan that meets criteria set by NYCPS. Additional guidance and expectations for this strategic implementation plan can be found in the glossary section of this manual. Where possible, vendors should work with district teams to support integration of strategic implementation plans with priorities from District Comprehensive Educational Plans (DCEPs).
- Collaborate with district leadership to align on the dosage and content of visits for the district and for schools, set expectations with schools for scheduling management, and support ensuring that the district's implementation plan is internalized and implemented at the school level.
- Collaborate with district leadership to support school leaders with programming and use of school time to develop the structures needed for implementation to be successful.
- Collaborate with district coaches to align support and follow-up between vendor partner visits and build sustainable practices.
- Engage in regular check-ins with the district team to review relevant data, discuss progress and trends, and collaborate on relevant adjustments to support, utilizing the strategic implementation plan as a guide.
- Engage in other district-level support in service of the district's strategic implementation priorities and as determined in collaboration with the district leadership. This may include supporting district-wide opportunities for multiple stakeholders, including school leaders, coaches, teachers, families, etc.

### For vendors providing Job Embedded Support for MTSS within NYC Reads, in addition to the above, support and collaboration will also include:

- Collaborating with district leadership to ensure strategic implementation plans reflect MTSS guidance and priorities.
- Supporting the district superintendent and district leadership team to build knowledge of effective and coherent MTSS services and tools, resources, and systems required to support them in alignment with NYCPS centrally provided guidance.

## School Leader and Supervisor Collaboration and Support:

As leaders of their buildings, school leaders play a crucial role in ensuring the sustainable impact of NYC Reads and NYC Solves. As such, deeply involved school leaders and their leadership teams are essential in the success of Job-Embedded Support and play a critical role in partnering with vendors to create the systems and structures that will enable them to replicate and sustain that support within their buildings long term. Support providers will partner with school leadership and their teams by:

- Developing a strong working relationship to collaborate effectively.
- Collaboratively developing year-long implementation plans grounded in high-quality curriculum with a lens toward sustainable structures and practices that ensure schools are set up to sustain the work, independent of support in future years.
- Supporting school leaders with programming and use of school time to develop the structures needed for implementation to be successful for all involved educators.
- Supporting school leaders to build their understanding of what excellent curriculum-based instruction looks like for all learners and provide feedback to teachers aligned with this understanding.
- Collaborating with school-based coaches to align supports and follow-up between vendor partner visits and build sustainable practices.
- Engaging in shared learning walks that support school leadership teams and teacher teams to deepen their understanding of best practices related to Math and/or Literacy Shifts and curricula, and develop school leadership teams to do the same.
- Support the capacity building of teacher teams utilizing strategies as laid out in the glossary of strategies in this manual.
- Build the capacity of school-based teams to hold the knowledge, skills, systems, and structures that can continue beyond the duration of external vendor support. This includes developing school-based coaches, teacher leaders, or others in the building to facilitate and lead teacher job-embedded school support in the following years.

### For vendors providing Job Embedded Support for MTSS, in addition to the above, support and collaboration will also include:

- Collaborating with school leadership team to set and monitor school-level goals for MTSS, data use, and strategic interventions.

## Teacher Collaboration and Support:

To build sustainable knowledge, skills, practices, and structures, Job-Embedded Support providers will establish strong relationships that will allow them to partner with teams of teachers (through grade-level teams, PLCs, or other school-specific structures) to design and facilitate cycles of support. All support will be in service of the required curricula in alignment with New York City's research-based Mathematics Shifts and Literacy Shifts (K-5, 6-8).

The vast majority of time providers spend with teachers at the school level will involve working with teams rather than individual teachers, to maximize the efficiency of Job-Embedded Support and support sustainability. 1-on-1 support will only happen in exceptional cases, such as a small school with a single grade-level teacher. In setting up their work with teams, it is critical that JESPs work with schools to ensure that teams are reflective of teachers who support all students within a given grade level or subject area. This includes ensuring that Bilingual, ENL, and Special Education teachers are included to ensure that team support, planning, and learning are reflective of all student learning needs within a grade level and/or school community.

Teacher team support will involve balancing time to engage with teams outside the classroom and in-classroom support and follow-up to ensure teachers can connect planning and preparation to in-classroom practice. In-classroom support will primarily involve teams of teachers, will be a part of a cycle of team development, and include specific strategies (such as modeling) selected based on student and teacher needs data. In-class support should rarely focus solely on teacher-by-teacher observation and feedback cycles.

Specific strategies for support will be selected based on the focus of the development cycle, will be data-driven, and will support teachers both inside of and outside of the classroom in service of sustainability. The next section of the Job Embedded Support Manual (JESM) will include a Glossary that provides further detail on these strategies.

The specific approach for cycles of development will vary by grade level, content area, and phase and year within NYC Reads and NYC Solves. Specific guidance for how providers will be asked to approach cycles of development can be found in the content-specific sections of this manual.

### For vendors providing Job Embedded Support for MTSS, in addition to the above, support and collaboration will also include:

- Facilitating and/or co-facilitating with district leadership, district-wide professional learning for all relevant teaching staff to set vision and roll out district strategy for MTSS and build specific knowledge and skills related to MTSS programs, systems, and structures.
- Facilitating and/or co-facilitating with district or school leadership data/intervention meetings with teacher teams for the purpose of building internal school and district capacity to lead effective data meetings long term.
- Supporting teachers with use of data in alignment with school and district-level systems to drive instructional decisions to support all students.
- Providing unpacking, planning, in-class support, and/or continuous improvement support for use of the school's intervention programs in alignment with the school and/or district strategy and data.

**The systems, structures, and responsibilities identified in this document will ensure that NYC Reads and NYC Solves meet their intended goals, leading to a lasting impact for students across the city for years.**

## A Note about Data Usage in Job Embedded Support:

Data is a powerful tool throughout all of Job-Embedded Support (JES), and JES providers should consistently work alongside district, school, and teacher partners to ensure supports are data-driven and directly responsive to needs. However, please note the following reminders about what is and is not permissible for data usage by vendor partners as part of NYC Reads and Solves.

- **Vendors do not have the required signed data-sharing agreements** (specific to data storage and use) with the NYC Department of Education.
- **Student work analysis is valuable and can inform strong coaching and support. However, only the district can collect student work and other school or district-level data.**
- **Vendors may review and analyze student work and/or school or district-level data in partnership with the district**, when the district collects the data and sits with vendor partners to engage in a shared conversation around instructional strategy and coaching.
- **Do not collect data or student work independently**, even for internal use, without a signed DOE data-sharing agreement.

## Sustainable Capacity Building at the Teacher Team Level:

Specific strategies for building the capacity of teacher teams should be data-driven and selected from the list below based on the focus of a given development cycle. Job Embedded Support Providers should ensure they have deeply internalized the purpose and use cases for a given support strategy and utilize the aligned resources (where provided) when using these strategies with teachers. **Additional guidance on how and when Job Embedded Support Providers are expected to use each of these strategies can be found in the content-specific guidance for JESPs later in this manual.** Additionally, more resources will be added to this guidance as they become available.

JES providers must keep in mind that sustainable capacity building through JES has a goal of ensuring that schools and districts will be set up for success to continue to lead in this work without the support of an external partner, and is a critical focus of JES. The strategies within the chart below will build the capacity of teacher teams to prepare for, lead, and reflect upon instruction that supports all learners, including students who are multiple years below grade level, MLLs/ELs, and Students with IEPs. These strategies must be implemented through sustainable structures and protocols with teacher teams that include educators who support all students including educators of MLLs/ELs, and Students with IEPs. In service of sustainability, JES providers must work with school leaders to develop a timeline wherein school-based staff and/or teacher teams are able to self-facilitate all teacher-level support. This timeline should be reflected within the school's strategic plan for implementation. JES providers should keep in mind that all of the strategies below should be used with sustainable capacity building as the goal. As such, capacity building steps such as aligning on next steps that teacher and leader teams will take between provider coaching visits to maintain momentum in the work, supporting reflection on systems, structures, and processes to ensure they work within the context of the school, and working with school leadership to ensure systems and structures regularly support teacher team work, should be a part of every planned teacher team interaction.

*Please note that in the chart below, resources have been provided for strategies where available. We expect to add to this resource list over the course of the upcoming year.*

| Strategy | What is this strategy? | NYC Reads Specific Resources | NYC Solves Specific Resources |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Unit/Module internalization | Unit/Module internalization is the process used to help teams of educators plan and deliver effective instruction that is aligned with the standards, the curriculum, and the students' needs. Unit internalization is a structured process that guides educators to analyze and identify the unit/module goals, the learning outcomes and key learning moments, the highest leverage instructional strategies/routines, the critical content, and the assessment methods. By internalizing the unit, educators ensure that they have a clear vision of what they want their students to learn and how they will measure their progress. | Coming Soon | Unit Internalization Protocol |
| Lesson Internalization | Lesson internalization is the process a teacher uses to understand the content and instructional intent of a lesson and to plan how to ensure access and rigor for all students. | Coming Soon | Lesson Internalization Protocol |
| Deepening understanding of the content, standards, or instructional shifts | A prerequisite to effectively implementing HQIM in any content area with all students is a deep understanding of the content, standards, and instructional shifts. This strategy involves JESPs supporting educators to deepen their understanding of the content they are teaching and how students are intended to experience learning of that content in the classroom. | Utilizing components of the NYCPS Science of Reading Modules and the Literacy Shifts (K-5, 6-8) NYCPS SOR Modules and Instructions for Use *Note that SOR modules are shared here as a resource to ensure JESPs are aligning learning to NYCPS content. JESPs should not facilitate SOR modules for schools in lieu of coaching or other active support.

| Lesson Rehearsal | Lesson rehearsal gives educators a chance to practice key instructional routines in a low-stakes, supportive environment. This helps build their confidence and leads to more consistent and rigorous implementation of high-quality instruction. | | Role Play Protocol |
| Professional Learning Sessions | Professional learning provided as part of Job-Embedded Support should focus on a specific high-leverage need, identified as part of the Job-Embedded Support, and should build capacity at the school or district level. Professional learning should be built on city or district-wide content or curriculum professional learning provided to teachers and should be aligned to the NYCPS instructional shifts in literacy (K-5, 6-8) and math. Professional learning as part of job-embedded support may include grade-wide or school-wide in-person professional learning on a teacher's move, an element of the lesson structure, or content using curricular resources or other NYCPS citywide instructional resources (i.e., explicit instruction or small group instruction guidance) Includes school-based leaders as co-planners, co-facilitators, and/or participants (principals and/or APs, school-based coaches) to build capacity in the school. Coaching days for multi-school or district-wide in-person professional learning should be used sparingly, with a priority on intervisitation or targeted needs, should include district leaders as co-planners, co-facilitators, and/or participants, and should always include elements that build capacity for the district team to sustain the next steps. | **Essential Elements of NYCPS Professional Learning** **Illustrative** – Provides concrete examples of eliciting student thinking and supports for all students through videos, modeled lessons, and peer observations to help educators visualize high-quality, inclusive practices. **Active** – Engages educators in directly applying and experiencing instructional strategies that center student thinking and benefit all learners. **Reflective** – Builds in structured opportunities for self-reflection and feedback focused on strengthening practices to center student thinking and meet the needs of all students. **Collaborative** – Promotes meaningful collaboration focused on centering student thinking, allowing educators to learn from one another and build shared responsibility for the success of all students across classrooms and schools. **Job-Embedded** – Anchors professional learning in the real-time work of delivering instruction to center student thinking and meet the needs of all students. **Sustained** – Offers repeated and connected learning experiences that deepen educators' understanding of Tier 1 expectations and supports, targeting sustainable practices that lead to equitable, lasting outcomes for all students. | |
| Modeling | Modeling is regularly used as a strategic support to help teams of teachers build deep expertise in content and curriculum. The type and extent of modeling will be determined based on data, school leader, and teacher feedback around needs. Modeling includes both partial and complete lessons. Vendor staff should be prepared to engage in modeling with any of the curricula used in the districts/schools they are supporting (Solves: Illustrative Math, Amplify Desmos Math, and/or i-Ready Classroom Math curriculums; Reads: HMH, EL, Wit & Wisdom, and approved intervention and foundational skills programs where relevant) Modeling takes place within a cycle of development, with groups of teachers, with and without students, and includes a pre-meeting to determine the learning focus, as well as a debrief to solidify key takeaways and next steps. **Before engaging in any in-class support strategies, providers should engage with teachers in a planning session. During this time, activities should include:** • Collaboratively unpacking the learning goals of the lesson • Setting the focus for the in-class support strategy (i.e., identifying a component of the lesson or a particular instructional routine that teachers most need support with and would benefit from seeing modeled or engaging in a side-by-side coaching experience) • Identifying which activities and routines students will engage with and planning facilitation moves to support student engagement • Anticipating student strategies and/or potential misconceptions and planning for how they will be addressed. • Aligning on roles and responsibilities during in-class support (i.e., if the JES-P is modeling, what are teachers doing, if the JES-P is side-by-side coaching, where will they step in, and what should teachers be doing when they do?) • Setting expectations for viewing the lesson, what to look for, and previewing what the debrief will focus on | | |
| Side-by-Side coaching | Side-by-side coaching is a real-time, in-the-moment coaching approach where the coach provides immediate, targeted support to a teacher during a live lesson through discreet verbal and visual cues (i.e., whispering to the teacher, visual cue cards, headset communication, etc.) for direct, real-time feedback. This model ensures that the teacher can adjust their instructional move in the moment, reinforcing best practices and enhancing student learning experiences. Side-by-side coaching is regularly used as a strategic support to help teams of teachers build deep expertise in the new curriculum. Side-by-side coaching will be focused on targeted areas of focus or instructional routines within or across lessons as determined by data, and school leader and teacher feedback on needs. Side-by-side coaching includes both partial and complete lessons and is an opportunity for the coach to provide teacher teams in the moment feedback during their live lessons with students. Side-by-side coaching takes place within a cycle of development with groups of teachers and includes a pre-meeting/pre-planning session to determine the learning focus and collaboratively pre-plan for the lesson, as well as a debrief to solidify key takeaways and next steps | | |
| Classroom visits | There are some instances when it is appropriate and encouraged for a job-embedded support provider to engage in classroom visits as a strategy for teacher and/or school leader support. This includes: • Conducting brief visits across a subset of classrooms in partnership with a Principal, AP, or content area supervisor as part of initial visits, progress monitoring, norming on effective practice, or supporting model classrooms. • Facilitating intervisitation in which the job-embedded support provider facilitates a team of teachers visiting one teacher's classroom. Any classroom visits should have a predetermined focus and include an opportunity to reflect and debrief. **Individual teacher classroom visits and feedback conversations are not a sustainable, capacity-building strategy and should not be used as part of job-embedded support.** | | |
| Unit Reflection | Unit reflection is an opportunity for educators to analyze how their instruction and implementation impacted student learning. This process informs what to continue, adjust, or add to better support all students moving forward. | | Unit Reflection Protocol |
| Student work analysis meetings | Job Embedded Support Provider facilitates reflection on student work in a structured protocol to engage educators in reflecting on the impact of their practice on student learning. These protocols should be grounded in student learning and identify the next steps to improve instruction. | | |
| Data meetings *JES providers should review all NYCPS provided guidance on student data prior to engaging in any data-related supports for teachers. | A data meeting is a structured and collaborative session where educators review student data to understand learning needs, identify strengths and areas for growth, and make informed decisions about instruction and next steps. | | |
