An arrow points down to a section titled "NYC Reads Instructional Focus" with an eye/search icon, containing text about "Eyes on Text: All students reading, discussing, and writing to make meaning of challenging texts every day." Below that is another arrow pointing to a section on "Evidence-Based Instructional Practices" with a gear icon, showing two boxes for "Small Group Instruction" and "Explicit Instruction." At the bottom is a final section with a ladder icon stating "Evidence-based instructional practices create access for diverse learners, including historically marginalized students, to engage with grade-level texts, tasks and content through approaches that are culturally responsive."]

## What do these practices look like in the context of our NYC Reads partnerships?

| Key Term | What It Looks Like |
|----------|-------------------|
| Meaning-making of challenging texts through daily reading, writing, and discussion | • Supporting educators with implementing HQIM with integrity, such that lessons center high-quality texts and skill/strategy instruction is employed in service of meaning making (rather as the end itself)<br>• Ensuring schedules reflect significant time for ALL students to engage in reading, writing, and discussion of texts |
| Small group instruction | • Supporting educators to use student work and data to diagnose student needs and inform the focus of small group instruction<br>• Ensuring small group instruction is coherent and aligned with core curricular aims, and happens both within and beyond Tier 1 instruction – based upon student needs |
| Explicit instruction | • Supporting educators to explicitly teach foundational skills<br>• Supporting educators to provide explicit instruction during core content instruction through the use of:<br>○ Think-alouds<br>○ Purposeful vocabulary instruction in the context of making-meaning of challenging texts |
| Culturally responsive approaches | • Supporting educators in building students' capacity to thrive as independent learners<br>• Challenging harmful narratives about the performance of marginalized students by identifying and removing systemic barriers to their success, including exclusion from high-quality instruction |
